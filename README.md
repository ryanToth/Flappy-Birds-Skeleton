Flappy-Birds-Skeleton
=====================

A mock flappy birds game with simple graphics. The "Flappy Birds Skeleton.jar" file has graphics consisting of simple shapes and one tone colors while the other .jar file has sprites and images along with slightly improved gameplay. The source code for both files are in their respective folders. In order to run the improved graphics version, the "highscore" folder must be in the same directory as the .jar or "src" files depending on the method of deployment. Just having the ".txt" will not work, the text file must be in a folder name highscore in order for the non-volatile highscore to function. The program will still work if the folder is omitted.

*I did not make nor do I own any of the sprites or backgorunds that I used in the game*
